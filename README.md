For practicing the Github Flow
Hey there, I am a full time student who works part time and is dedicating my free time to learning new things. I have two pet dogs and a fiance. I have been enjoying the weather from home and reading more than usual. My priorities have changes since being in school and I love how everything is coming together. Hopefully I will excell in this account.
